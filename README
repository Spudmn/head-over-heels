Head Over Heels reverse engineering
===================================

This is my attempt to reverse engineer the ZX Spectrum version of Head
Over Heels. I made a start before, but this time I'm trying to keep
some more notes, script it, source control it, etc. so that I've got a
better hope of tracking it all.

Contents
--------

tape - This directory holds my attempts to extract the contents from a
       tzx file. Somewhat abortive effort.

memimage - This holds a memory dump from the game on start-up, plus tools
           to extract and disassemble the dump, creating a baseline
           disassembly.
