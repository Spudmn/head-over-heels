# "memimage" directory

This directory holds a .z80 game file, from which a memory image can
be produced, disassembled, reassembled, and compared against the
reverse engineering under the src/ directory (useful for checking
nothing has broken).

It includes a hacked-up disassembler suitable for just tearing apart
this specific game, because I'm lazy and was happy to build a
throw-away solution.
